## Motivation

Recently, the tragedy of a Chinese grad student at Chicago University
killed in a shooting near the campus has raised great concern about gun
violence again. Being public health students living in NYC, gaining
deeper insights into the incidents of gun violence in the city, such as
the overall patterns of location or time and potential association with
other public health issues, would not only be beneficial for
self-protection, but might also be instrumental for advocating
prospective legislative changes to form safe communities in NYC. Our
project is mainly based on the gun violence crimes that happened in NYC
from 2006 to 2021. We also try to figure out the relationship between
the changes in frequency and distribution of shooting cases in NYC and
the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Anticipated data sources

[NYPD Shooting Incident - Data
2006-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/thedataperson/nypd-shooting-incident-data-20062021)  
[NYPD Shooting Incident Data
(Historic)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8)  
[NYPD Hate
Crimes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Hate-Crimes/bqiq-cu78)  
[COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and
Deaths](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/COVID-19-Daily-Counts-of-Cases-Hospitalizations-an/rc75-m7u3)

## Intended final product

-   A report of the spatial, temporal analysis, and potential relation
    to other factors of the distribution of shooting incidents in NYC.  
-   An app predicting shooting incidence in the future in specific
    locations within NYC.  
-   A website with all the work and results presented.

## Planned analysis / visualizations / coding challenges

-   Analysis
    -   Specific time period during the day and the year when shooting
        crimes are more likely to occur.
    -   Are there any boroughs or precincts with a significantly higher
        chance of shootings?
    -   Analysis on perpetrators’ and victims’ demographic
        characteristics.
    -   Whether there is an association between the number of shooting
        cases and COVID-19 (whether COVID-19 has caused an increasing
        number of shooting crimes).
    -   Whether the occurrence of shooting incidents is related to the
        number of COVID-19 cases in a certain borough.
-   Visualizations
    -   Visualization of the location of shooting incidents.
    -   Visualization of the time of shooting incidents.
    -   A map of shooting incidents happened.
    -   Heat map for shooting crimes combined with real geo-locations.  
    -   A graph combining the changing trend of the number of shooting
        cases and COVID-19 cases.
-   Coding challenges
    -   Combine two datasets respectively contain shooting incidence
        data regarding different time periods.
    -   Match the shooting incidence locations to an interactive map.
    -   Figure out one or more appropriate models to predict future
        shooting incidence.
