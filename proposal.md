## The motivation for this project

Recently, the tragedy of a Chinese grad student at Chicago University
killed in a shooting near the campus has raised great concern about gun
violence again. Being public health students living in NYC, gaining
deeper insights into the incidents of gun violence in the city, such as
the overall patterns of location or time and potential association with
other public health issues, would not only be beneficial for
self-protection, but might also be instrumental for advocating
prospective legislative changes to form safe communities in NYC. Our
project is mainly based on the gun violence crimes that happened in NYC
from 2006 to 2021. We also try to figure out the relationship between
the changes in frequency and distribution of shooting cases in NYC and
the Covid-19 pandemic.

## The anticipated data sources

NYPD Shooting Incident - Data 2006-2021  
NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic)  
NYPD Hate Crimes  
COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths

## The intended final products

A report of the spatial, temporal analysis, and potential relation to
other factors of the distribution of shooting incidents in NYC.  
An app predicting shooting incidence in the future in specific locations
within NYC.  
A website with all the work and results presented.

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

-   Planned analyses: Specific time period during the day and the year
    when shooting crimes are more likely to occur. Are there any
    boroughs or precincts with a significantly higher chance of
    shootings? Analysis on perpetrators’ and victims’ demographic
    characteristics. Whether there is an association between the number
    of shooting cases and COVID-19 (whether COVID-19 has caused an
    increasing number of shooting crimes). Whether the occurrence of
    shooting incidents is related to the number of COVID-19 cases in a
    certain borough. Predicting the shooting incidence in the future.

-   Visualization: Visualization of the location of shooting incidents.
    Visualization of the time of shooting incidents. A map of shooting
    incidents happened. Heat map for shooting crimes combined with real
    geo-locations. A graph combining the changing trend of the number of
    shooting cases and COVID-19 cases.

-   Coding challenges： Combine two datasets respectively contain
    shooting incidence data regarding different time periods. Match the
    shooting incidence locations to an interactive map. Figure out one
    or more appropriate models to predict future shooting incidence.
